# CUDA-password-cracker
Password cracker developed as the final project of CPSC 4780 - Gen Purpose Computation on GPU at Clemson University.

This program runs on CUDA, and thus requires an NVIDIA GPU and the nvcc compiler to run.

It takes in a password of up to 5 characters and uses a brute-force multithreading algorithm to crack the password within 0.4 seconds.

To run this program from the terminal, enter "ssh run" in the terminal to compile the code, then enter "/password_cracker" to execute the program.
